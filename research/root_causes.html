            <p>Linguistics is the scientific study of language. In other words, it is the systematic study of language’s form, function, and use. Linguists try to create a theory of language by breaking language down into smaller parts and carefully researching those. Subfields of linguistics include phonetics/phonology (the study of sounds), morphology (the study of words), syntax (the study of sentences and phrases), and semantics and pragmatics (the study of meaning and context of language).

            <p>Phonaesthetics sits at the intersection of two major fields of linguistics, phonetics and sociolinguistics. Phonetics is the study of sounds: where they appear, how they change, and how we make them. Sociolinguistics is linguistics in combination with sociology. Sociolinguists study the social aspect of language: context around language, people’s linguistic biases, and how people perceive language.             </p>

            Linguists collect data to draw conclusions from in a variety of ways, from interviews to experiments. For sociolinguistic studies, there are three main methods relevant to phonaesthetics: recorded interviews, rapid anonymous surveys (RAS), and online surveys. 
Recorded interviews offer the advantage of getting demographics and data about the person being interviewed, having plenty of time to ask questions, and the ability to play back what the informant has said. The participant, however, knows they are taking part in a study and therefore their responses may be different from casual conversation. In addition, finding people to interview may be more difficult as formal consent is needed in order to be recorded.
RAS involves asking many the same question or set of questions in quick succession in order to gain a large amount of data from a wide spread of sources. This technique was pioneered by Bill Labov in his classic <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist62n/labov001.pdf">1966 study</a> where he conducted RAS with workers at NYC department stores to determine the interaction between social class and accent. While this data is anonymized and relatively easy to obtain, it relies heavily on the interviewer’s manual recording skills.
Finally, online surveys, like the one used in Kogan and Reiterer (discussed in Case Study), allow for precise, anonymous, and quick collection of data. However, some data may be harder to obtain over an online survey, and there is room for user error.
