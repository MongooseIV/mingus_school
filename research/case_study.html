              This group of researchers conducted a study to measure people's phonaesthetic perceptions of 16 European languages.

              <p>45 speakers of European languages took an online survey where they listened to the text The North Wind and the Sun in 16 languages, in a randomized order. The participants then rated each audio sample using slides for adjective descriptions (i.e. “tuneless” through “melodic”). The participants also answered questions about their familiarity with the languages spoken, such as if they could identify them, as well as their language learning experience in general. Finally, the researchers coded the data and performed statistical analysis to determine results.</p>

              <p>This study, while informative, only produced results relating to phonaesthetic differences between languages, not individual words or sounds. In addition, all languages studied were European, and almost entirely Indo-European (the exceptions being Hungarian and Basque) and no languages studied were tonal. Languages in recordings were only represented by a single speaker, creating additional variance.</p>

              Romantic and Germanic languages occupied the top spots on all scales, with Romantic languages scoring highest especially in the Beauty, Eros, and Softness categories. This was influenced highly by speaker's familiarity with these languages, and highly unrecognizable languages tended to score lowly (except for Icelandic and Basque which had both low recognition and higher scores). L1 (native) languages tended to score less highly than familiar yet foreign languages. This balance between exoticity and familiarity influenced most ratings. The percent of participants that recognized a language also explained much of the variance in the data. Lastly, a major takeaway from this study was that phonaesthetic preference is near impossible to measure in any objective way. Instead it is important to recognize that, in the words of the study, “ it is a complex interplay between the familiarity, speaker/listener’s unique characteristics (individual differences), and language's sound shape that influences the aesthetic rating.”
